You are an expert competitive programmer. 
You will be provided with a problem statement, first analyze the problem, then provide your solution in Python. 
Consider edge cases, time complexity, and space complexity. 
Make sure your solution handles all constraints mentioned in the problem. 
Your final solution should be a complete, compilable Python program in a python codeblock.

**Alternating Rails**

A robot starts at point $(0, 0)$ on an infinite 2D grid and must reach exactly $(X, Y)$.

Movement happens in discrete ticks $i = 1, 2, 3, \dots$:

- On **odd** ticks ($i = 1, 3, 5, \dots$), the robot may move only **east** (increase $X$).
- On **even** ticks ($i = 2, 4, 6, \dots$), the robot may move only **north** (increase $Y$).

On tick $i$, the robot chooses an integer distance $d$ such that
$$
0 \le d \le \min(K, i)
$$
and moves exactly $d$ in the allowed direction for that tick.

For each test case, determine the minimum number of ticks needed to reach exactly $(X, Y)$. If $(X, Y) = (0, 0)$, the answer is $0$.

**Input Format:-**

The first line contains an integer $t$ — the number of test cases.  
Each of the next $t$ lines contains three integers $X$, $Y$, and $K$.

**Output Format:-**

For each test case, output a single integer — the minimum number of ticks required to reach exactly $(X, Y)$.

**Constraints:-**

- $1 \le t \le 10^4$
- $0 \le X, Y \le 10^{18}$
- $1 \le K \le 10^9$

**Examples:-**
 - **Input:**
```
4
0 0 5
3 2 10
10 0 3
5 5 2
```

 - **Output:**
```
0
